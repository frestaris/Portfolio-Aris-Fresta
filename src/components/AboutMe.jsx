          With an Italian-Greek background, I have been living in Australia for
          10 years now, where I have settled my own family. I have always had a
          strong passion for web development. Although I haven't had
          professional experience in the field yet, I have spent several years
          dedicated to self-learning and developing foundational skills in web
          development. Through online courses, tutorials, and personal projects,
          I have acquired a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My
          self- driven approach to learning, coupled with a natural aptitude for
          grasping new concepts quickly, has equipped me with the ability to
          adapt in new environments. I am ready to bring my skills and passion
          to the next level and finally make it my profession.
